# CLIGE_2
The second version of my Command-Line Interface Game Engine, now with a lot more features!

Sprites can now be colorful, and shapes other than just rectangles!

Entities can detect collisions with one another!

Regions of the screen are now fully customizable!

So much more I can't remember right now!
